# Devcontainers

## Ubuntu

The Ubuntu container is not optimal. I tried to see if using a standard Ubuntu Latest image would improve build times, but the need bundler and ruby installation needs to be explicit instead. So the ruby bookworm is faster

## Ruby (Recommended)

It favors Ruby, Bundle, Gems it's simply a better off-set.
